# DL_Final_RedPandaGo

## BaseLine-Preprocessed-Checkoff2 folder: 
Contains our earliest upload for data proprocessing and basic pytorch implementation. This is for checkoff2. Please refer to README in this folder for more details about dataset. The problems we found and process for that time are listed in check_off2_problems.docx.

## Baseline-tensorflow folder: 
We changed our model to use tensorflow. It contains a baseline_model3.py using three convolutional layer to train our model.
baseline_model3-gpu.py is a version that only can run with GPU detected. 

## Multi-head-base-checkedoff3 folder:
This folder is for check-off 3 which we add our transformer after three convolutional layer model. 

## Muti-head-improved:
This is a improved version of muti-head and convolution model implementation. Our PPT for final presentation should be in this folder. It has both muti-head and single-head implemented for transformer.

## Project-final:
This forder contains the final version of our code for now. Please refer to the README in this forder for more details. The final project report should be in this folder. There is a result folder inside which has all our testing output log file with different parameters.
