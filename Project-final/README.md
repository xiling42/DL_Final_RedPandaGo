## conv_transformer_result folder
This folder contains our output log for three convolutional layer with transfoer after convolutional layers. 'after1conv' means transformer is after first convolutional layer and 'after3conv' means transformer is applied after three convolutional layer. We trained using 2 and epochs based on 10000 and 60000 training data.

## kmers_result folder
This folder contains our output lof for using k-mers and transformer before convolutional layers. 

## final_report_correct_muban.docx:
Our final report for this project.

## motif-find-model-kmer.py:
Code using k-mers and transformer before convolutional layers model

## motif-find-model.py:
Code using three convolutional layer and transformers.
